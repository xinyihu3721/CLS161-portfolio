### An Overview of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ###

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire provided a historical trace from the height of the Roman Empire to the fall of Byzantine. This book achieved significant historical importance and overcame difficulties that many of Gibbon's contemporaries were unable to overcome. Gibbon provided a more comprehensive historical analysis than many of his contemporaries due to the lack of evidence and textual material. Nevertheless, some criticism also argues that Gibbon’s analysis is not adequate and accurate due to the lack of information, especially in the later volume which discusses the fall of the Byzantine. Due to the lack of evidence and textual material at the location where Gibbon was, he was unable to receive enough information; thus, many of his historical accounts, reasoning behind events, and conclusions might not be accurate or even counterfactual in some cases. Furthermore, some people are not willing to embrace the underlying reasoning that Gibbon provided to explain the fall of the Roman empire.

If there was a system similar to digital humanity existed during Gibbon’s period, I believe the stories inside the book, The Decline, and Fall of the Roman Empire, will capture a more all-around picture since the biggest reason that prohibited Gibbon to have access to adequate material is due to physical difficulties, and languages. As mentioned in the previous two reading posts, one of the advantages of digital humanities is that it granted higher accessibility to text for humanities scholars. For example, scholars can read a virtual online scanned version of ancient Roman literature that is physically stored thousands of miles away at home on their laptops.
   
Besides the lack of comprehensiveness in this book, some people also criticized the invalid arguments that Gibbon provided to explain the fall of the Roman empire. Gibbon relates the physical fall of the empire with people's moral decadence, which links to the rise of Christianity, and many present scholars do not agree with the argument. Gibbon argues the rise of Christianity limited the freedom of intellect and much of the wealth had been used in secular events, which used to promote religion activities.  

Digitial humanities bring unprecedent change to the classical humanities analysis method and allowed scholars to have a more overarching understanding of history. As we learn more from history, we might identify more factors that correlate to an historical event or change. But how do we decide which is the key factor if it exist?
