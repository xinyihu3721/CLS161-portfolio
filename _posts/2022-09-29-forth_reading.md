### [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) ###

This paper addresses how the development of technology promotes the development of science and our understanding of nature. The paper starts with the opening argument of how scientific specialization boosts the depth of knowledge in each specialized discipline while the bridge between disciplines is superficial and makes some discoveries and research results impenetrable to the layperson and undermining the value of some research. This argument suggests the importance of communication between disciplines and the influence of technology development on communication and data storage.  

In the following few sections of the article, the author expands on the development of cameras, audio tools, electrical tools (i.e. TV), and computer systems, which boost the exchange of information with drawbacks, and those drawbacks will be addressed later in this reflection. The emergence of cameras and audio recording devices allowed scientists to photograph and record their research results and the process.   

The author also tried to identify the meaning of digitalized research process. It feels to me that he is degrading the digitalized research process because this process to him is the manipulation of symbols, especially the data analysis part. He makes an analogy between the data manipulation with the mathematician, who “is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane... All else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism”. The danger of overly relying on this research method is the loss of authenticity with nature. I am not sure about his attitude towards mathematicians here. Maybe it is a compliment to admit the mathematician “is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes he employs”. But I am annoyed by this statement because it undermines the innate beauty of math.   

Besides, he also mentioned the difference between computer logic and human associative logic, which allows us to build connections among things. Now we have more advanced algorithms that simulate such associative logic. For example, the Page Rank algorithm ranks the importance of a webpage based on the importance of its linked pages.   

The improvement in machine learning and search algorithms provided humans with excessive information and convenience compared to 50 years ago. Now, the question becomes how to rank and decide the importance and authenticity of information while facing an abundance of them. Algorithms such as the PageRank algorithm might be able to help.
