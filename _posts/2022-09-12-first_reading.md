## Chapter 1 - *What are the humanities?* ##

Reading for this week is the introductory chapter of the book “The Humanities”. In this chapter, the author introduced the definition of humanities; how it differs from social sciences, and the importance of humanities.  

According to the author, humanities is a universal concept that can be applied to all human beings irrespective of their background. It can be considered as we try to understand how we construct and experience the world we live in, and it is about how human studies human. Humanities consider human actions as the bearers of meaning. That means our actions have intrinsic meaning to it, and we express who we are via our actions and productions such as art.  

It is important for us to study humanities because it helps us to understand ourselves better. Analyzing previous documents and artifacts enables us to see the world from different perspectives so that we can have a more comprehensive understanding of various cultures, identities, and humans. Therefore, objectivity is one of the most important characteristics of humanities studies. The role of a humanities scholar is never to judge but to conduct methodologically agnostic analysis.  

There are many ways for conducting humanities research, and our class will focus on digital methods. While many of the digital methods applied in humanities have also been implemented in other social science fields, there are distinctions between the two. From my understanding, social science aims to find causes of behavior with emphasis on mode, statistics. I can strongly relate myself to such research methods because of my psychology background, where people might use rising heart rate data as an indicator for rising anxiety. On the contrary, humanity seeks meanings of our behavior.  

As the difference between humanities and social sciences mentioned above, my first question will be how do research methods differ for linguistics and language studies in humanities or if they are eventually the same? Second, since humanities seek to find the meaning of our behavior, but sometimes our behavior does not convey any meaning, how do how if we find the correct interpretation? In other words, how can we validate our conclusions for humanities’ research?
