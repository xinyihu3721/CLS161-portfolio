### The Measured Words: How Computers Analyze Text ###

This article demonstrates how computers analyze text and introduced Voyant as a sample tool that helps to show the use of computers in text analysis. It also emphasizes the key idea that computers treat texts differently from human perception.  

The article begins with the novel *Galatea 2.2* written by Richard Power to show how computers is unable to experience the world as humans. This idea is later emphasized with the example of Chinese Room, which explains the manipulation of rules and symbols is not helpful for the understanding of a language. And as explained in the paper, computer analysis is merely the manipulation of symbols, which is irrelevant to the understanding of text. Also, to guarantee the objectivity of data analysis, the algorithm and the procedure of analysis must be objective, and it implies that we should not have a system that understands the text in the same way as human does.  

The article also expounds on what characters, words, and sentences are for computers. For computers, analyzing data is not different from looking for general patterns between unrecognizable symbols. To simplify the analysis process, researchers need to standardize the presentation of characters, tokenize sentences, and apply statistical tools to “measure” texts.  

The text also mentions that one should be careful about the assumption that the linear order of text reading because the linear result might not be meaningful. Sometimes if the text is arranged based on alphabetical order, then linear order is no longer important. The question now is when the linear order is trivial, how should scholars construct connection within the text through computer analysis. What should be some alternative visualization and analysis lthods in the case described above?   

I love the quote “in all humanities disciplines the computer is used in an endeavor to replace intuition with quantification” because it demonstrates that while computer analysis is not used for proving, it can provide new ideas for scholars.
