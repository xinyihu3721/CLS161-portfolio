### The Measured Words: How Computers Analyze Text ###

This article demonstrates how computers analyze text and introduces Voyant as a sample tool to show the application of computers in textual analysis. It also emphasizes the key idea of how computers treat texts differently from human perception without attaching meaning to the text.  
The article begins with the novel *Galatea 2.2* written by Richard Power to show that computers are incapable of experiencing and perceiving the world as humans. This idea is later emphasized with the philosophical analogy of the Chinese Room, which explains the manipulation of rules and symbols is not helpful for the understanding of languages. And as explained in the paper, computer analysis is only the manipulation of symbols, which is irrelevant to the textual understanding. However, such detachment of meaning is important since it guarantees the objectivity of data analysis. The algorithm and the procedure of analysis must be objective; thus, we should not have a system that understands the text in the same way as a human does.  
The article expounds on what characters, words, and sentences are for computers. For computers, analyzing data is not different from looking for general patterns between unrecognizable symbols. To simplify the analysis process, researchers need to standardize the presentation of characters, tokenize sentences, and apply statistical tools to “measure” texts.  
The text also mentions that people should be careful about the assumption about the linear order of text reading because the linear result might not be meaningful. Sometimes the text is arranged based on alphabetical order. In that case, the linear order is no longer consequential. **I wonder if the linear order is trivial, how should scholars reconstruct connections within the text through computer analysis? What are some alternative visualization and analysis methods to deal with the scenario described above**?   
I love the quote “in all humanities disciplines the computer is used in an endeavor to replace intuition with quantification” because it demonstrates that while computer analysis is not used for proving, it can provide new ideas for scholars.
