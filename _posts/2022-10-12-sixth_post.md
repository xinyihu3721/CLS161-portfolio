## Sacred Reading: From Augustine to the Digital Humanists ##

The key idea Chad Wellmon raised in his paper “Sacred reading: from Augustine to the Digital Humanists,” is that digital humanity expanded the boundaries of literature and allowed scholars to embrace and explore the nature of literature.   

As mentioned at the beginning of the reading, the author admits there are opposing voices against the application of technology in text analysis. For example, the process of algorithmic analysis of texts necessitates reductivism, which ultimately leads to the removal of distinction among literature.   

But this is not the first time that the definition of literature and reading evolved. The author introduced the concept of distance reading which can be interpreted as the opposite of personal and close reading. While personal reading generates emotional and intellectual recognition and requires readers to scrutinize and focus on the analysis of a single piece, distance reading tries to find the overall general and transitional pattern in literature history. Distance reading also treats each textual element equally as part of the “regular, law-governed order of nature”. Digital analysis should be considered as distance reading.   

The definition and expectation of reading literature changed in history. Reading is equivalent to receiving and learning about divine knowledge, and there is a seven-step technique that humans follow while reading Augustine. A few centuries later, the rise of humanity during the Renaissance transformed the meaning of the text to be objects filled with meaning that can be independent of divine intent. Consequently, the definition of reading has been extended to encountering and experiencing "surging emotions" and "vague, wandering thoughts" in the written text by Petrarch. Later, literature was defined as an expression of "Geist" by Schlegel, and philologists assigned meaning to the text itself.   

As mentioned at the beginning of the reflection, the introduction of digital humanities in the textual analysis involved reductivism, and it is hard to argue that such reductivism is justifiable even given that such a method indeed expanded the boundaries of literature and allowed scholars to embrace and explore the patterns in literature. Therefore, I propose to consider the following two questions: 1. Can machine learning justify and examine the aesthetic value in various literature? If so, what should be the standard? 2. Is there any successful digital analysis demonstrating the transition of literature definition?
